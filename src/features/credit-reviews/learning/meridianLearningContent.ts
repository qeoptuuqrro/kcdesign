    simple: "Intelligence scopes your question, reads approved context, reconciles the relevant analysis, and prepares a briefing. The visible work trace makes those steps clear while the answer is being prepared.",
    professional: "The Intelligence workflow separates prompt scoping, approved-source retrieval, analytical reconciliation, and response synthesis. The work trace communicates process state without implying autonomous decision authority.",
    aiSteps: ["Resolved the requested review, finding, or portfolio context.", "Read only the selected approved sources or model scenarios.", "Reconciled the relevant assessment and prepared a decision-oriented response."],

Moderate means the issue still matters, but the current evidence shows less immediate impact. This is a starting rating—not the final decision.",
    professional: "The finding taxonomy currently uses two initial risk bands: Material and Moderate. Meridian's customer concentration begins as Material because 61% top-two exposure exceeds the 50% monitoring threshold and the original Customer A contract had limited remaining duration. Verified renewal evidence can reduce near-term risk to Moderate without removing structural concentration.",
